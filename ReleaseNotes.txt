# Release Notes

## 2.0.0-b03
Flatten Hierarchy, reduces usings 
Optional params in builder changed to use overloads http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2010/05/18/caveats-of-c-4-0-optional-parameters/
Builder fix, not passing assign in Build(int, int, Action<T, int>) overload
Organising Random and Static data resources

## 2.0.0-b04
Added fallback singleton DataContainer in Data.Container
Reorganised resources to property of DataContainer
Moved models from DataContainer to Models dir and renamed to avoid amibutity

## 2.0.0-b05
Random..Builder => ..Builder randomness implied
StringBuilder => TextBuilder not going to clash
Allow TextBuilder.Create to accept chars to build with
DataResource properties from array to IEnumerable - easier to work with less .ToArray()
ValueBuilder Create=>With value types not having complex ctx
Builder.With returns a new cloned builder, matching behaviour of the ValueBuilder
BuildOne => BuildItem() better match with Build(1,10).Items
BuildItem() no longer takes assignment - use With(assignment)
Derived Builders now pass their own type to the generic base

## 2.0.0-b06
removed byte, short builders in favor of DoubleBuilder
Split random builder tests

## 2.0.0-b07
abstracting builders with interfaces for easy substution
added recursive generics for builders, allows common code in builder base classes

## 2.0.0-b08
finished abstraction of builders
moved abstracts to separate namespace makes it easier to see things
changed with methods on builders to more explicit name e.g. builder.WithPerson(p), easier to read and no chance of a name clash
named the models back removing Testing prefix - was too confusing
added top 500 domains

## 2.0.0-b09
moved create func to constructor to make it more obvious

## 2.0.0-b10
Data class for static data changed to TestData, makes more sense, less generic so won't clash as much
TestData.Container property flattened
Added WithLetters - common usage
DataContainer and DataResources members now virtual to allow overriding
*BuilderBase.CreateClone virtual, saves override where not needed

## 2.0.0-b11
FindResource extensions added for Type, use to get embedded resources

## 2.0.0-b12
IValueBuilder<T> and IBuilder<T> implement IEnumerable<T>, this removes the need for .Items, which was ambiguous and just extra code
Image test now disposes of the image created
Tidy up

## 2.0.0-b13
BuildItem() -> Build(), not sure why it wasn't in the first place
reinstated Build(Action<T> assign), a good short-cut and matches Build(int..) method signature
Updated readme.md with new functionality

## 2.0.0
Added overloads for IBuilder.Build with assign but no index
Release

##2.0.1
Added Benchmark class

##3.0.0-b01
Breaking v2.0.1 reorganising parameters to allow for multiple instances paramarray
Allow multiple runs to be called
Results classes added 'BenchmarkResult' and 'BenchmarkResultList'
Solution and Namespaces moved to Antix.Testing to be in-line with other stuff
